# On the Decidability of ALCI\_RCC5 and ALCI\_RCC8

**Quasimodels Meet the Patchwork Property**

This repository contains a proof that concept satisfiability in the description logics ALCI\_RCC5 and ALCI\_RCC8 is **decidable**, settling open problems from Wessel (2002/2003).

- **ALCI\_RCC5**: decidable, between PSPACE and EXPTIME
- **ALCI\_RCC8**: decidable, **EXPTIME-complete**

Two decision procedures are given: a type-elimination algorithm and a tableau calculus with blocking.

## Background

The ALCI\_RCC family extends the description logic ALCI (ALC with inverse roles) with **role boxes derived from RCC composition tables**. The base relations of RCC5 ({DR, PO, EQ, PP, PPI}) serve as the role names, and interpretations are constrained to be **complete graphs** where every pair of domain elements is related by exactly one base relation, subject to the RCC5 composition table.

These logics were introduced by Michael Wessel in his doctoral work at the University of Hamburg. He classified most of the family (ALCI\_RCC1 through ALCI\_RCC3) but left the decidability of ALCI\_RCC5 and ALCI\_RCC8 as open problems.

### Key Difficulties

- **No tree model property**: models are complete graphs (K\_n or K\_omega)
- **No finite model property**: some satisfiable concepts require infinite models
- **Non-deterministic role box**: the RCC5 composition table has multi-valued entries, ruling out reduction to ALCRA\_SG

### Key Enabler: The Patchwork Property

The proof exploits a result from qualitative constraint reasoning (Renz & Nebel, 1999):

> For RCC5 (and RCC8), an atomic constraint network is consistent if and only if it is path-consistent.

This means **local (triple-wise) consistency implies global consistency** for RCC5 base relation networks --- the patchwork property.

## The RCC5 Composition Table

Reading: row = S(b,c), column = R(a,b), entry = possible relations for (a,c). The symbol \* means all five relations are possible.

|  comp   | DR(a,b) | PO(a,b)     | EQ(a,b) | PPI(a,b)       | PP(a,b)     |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| DR(b,c) | \*      | DR,PO,PPI   | DR      | DR,PO,PPI      | DR          |
| PO(b,c) | DR,PO,PP| \*          | PO      | PO,PPI         | DR,PO,PP    |
| EQ(b,c) | DR      | PO          | EQ      | PPI            | PP          |
| PP(b,c) | DR,PO,PP| PO,PP       | PP      | PO,EQ,PP,PPI   | PP          |
| PPI(b,c)| DR      | DR,PO,PPI   | PPI     | PPI            | \*          |

## Results

### Main Theorem

**Concept satisfiability in ALCI\_RCC5 is decidable.**

The proof proceeds via two independent methods:

1. **Quasimodel method + type elimination** (EXPTIME upper bound)
2. **Tableau calculus with blocking** (constructive decision procedure)

Both rely on the patchwork property of RCC5.

### Complexity

| Logic      | Lower Bound          | Upper Bound | Exact        |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|--------------|
| ALCI\_RCC5 | PSPACE-hard (Wessel) | EXPTIME     | Open         |
| ALCI\_RCC8 | EXPTIME-hard (Wessel)| EXPTIME     | **EXPTIME-complete** |

## A Tableau Calculus for ALCI\_RCC5

### Overview

The tableau constructs a finite **completion graph** --- a complete graph where every pair of nodes has a base relation label, and every node has a concept label (a subset of the Fischer-Ladner closure of the input concept). Unlike tree-based DL tableaux, creating a new node requires assigning it a role to **every** existing node.

### Completion Graphs

A **completion graph** for a concept C\_0 is a tuple G = (V, L, E, <) where:

- V is a finite set of nodes
- L: V -> 2^{cl(C\_0)} assigns concept labels
- E: {(x,y) | x != y} -> {DR, PO, PP, PPI} assigns a base relation to every pair of distinct nodes, respecting converse (E(y,x) = inv(E(x,y)))
- < is a strict total order (creation order)

The **initial completion graph** has a single node x\_0 with L(x\_0) = {C\_0}.

### Blocking Condition

A node x is **blocked** if there exists y < x such that y is not blocked and L(x) = L(y).

This is **equality anywhere-blocking**: the blocker need only precede x in creation order and carry the same label. No pairwise matching (as in standard ALCI tree tableaux) is needed. The simplicity of this condition is made possible by the patchwork property, which decouples type-level structure from specific relational neighborhoods.

### Expansion Rules

**Propositional rules** (deterministic):

- **(and-rule)**: If D1 and D2 in L(x) and D1 or D2 missing: add both to L(x).
- **(or-rule)**: If D1 or D2 in L(x) and neither present: nondeterministically add D1 or D2. *(branching point)*

**Propagation rule** (deterministic):

- **(forall-rule)**: If (forall R.D) in L(x) and E(x,y) = R and D not in L(y): add D to L(y).

**Generating rule** (nondeterministic):

- **(exists-rule)**: If (exists R.D) in L(x), x is active (not blocked), and no y exists with E(x,y) = R and D in L(y):
  1. Create a fresh node y (greatest in creation order).
  2. Set L(y) := {D}.
  3. Set E(x,y) := R.
  4. For each existing node z != x,y: **nondeterministically choose** S\_z in {DR, PO, PP, PPI} and set E(z,y) := S\_z. *(branching point, with constraint filtering)*

### Constraint Filtering

After creating a new node y with edges to all existing nodes, **composition consistency** must hold for every triple of distinct nodes (u,v,w) involving y:

> E(u,w) in comp(E(u,v), E(v,w))

If no assignment of the S\_z values satisfies this for all triples simultaneously, the branch **closes** (clash).

By the patchwork property (Theorem of Renz & Nebel), a simultaneous satisfying assignment exists if and only if every triple involving y is individually satisfiable, i.e., the constraint network is path-consistent. Path consistency can be checked in O(|V|^3).

### Rule Application Strategy

1. Apply (and-rule), (or-rule), and (forall-rule) exhaustively to all nodes.
2. Re-evaluate blocking.
3. Apply one instance of (exists-rule) for an active node with an unsatisfied demand.
4. After adding the new node and its edges, apply (forall-rule) exhaustively (new edges may trigger propagations in both directions, cascading to other nodes).
5. Re-evaluate blocking (label changes may affect blocking status).
6. Repeat from step 1 until no rule applies or a clash is detected.

### Clash Conditions

A completion graph has a **clash** if:

- **(C1)** Some node has {A, not A} in its label for a concept name A.
- **(C2)** Composition consistency is violated for some triple.

A completion graph that is **saturated** (no rule applicable) and **clash-free** is called **open**.

### Termination

Every sequence of rule applications terminates. The final completion graph has at most **2^{O(|C\_0|)}** nodes.

**Argument**:
- Active (non-blocked) nodes have pairwise distinct labels, so there are at most 2^{|cl(C\_0)|} active nodes.
- Labels grow monotonically (rules only add concepts), so each label changes at most |cl(C\_0)| times.
- Each active node has at most |cl(C\_0)| existential demands, each generating at most one witness.
- Total nodes: at most 2^{|cl(C\_0)|} * |cl(C\_0)| = 2^{O(|C\_0|)}.

### Soundness

**Theorem**: If the tableau produces an open completion graph for C\_0, then C\_0 is satisfiable.

**Proof sketch**: Extract a quasimodel from the open completion graph:
- T = {L(x) | x active}
- P = {(L(x), E(x,y), L(y)) | x != y}
- tau\_0 = L(x\_0)

The quasimodel conditions are verified:
- **(Q1)** Existential demands are witnessed by saturation. Triple coherence holds because every triple in the completion graph is composition-consistent (clash-freeness).
- **(Q2)** Every pair of types has a role (the graph is complete).
- **(Q3)** PP-transitivity follows from composition consistency: comp(PP,PP) = {PP}.

By the main theorem (quasimodel <=> satisfiable), C\_0 is satisfiable. The actual (possibly infinite) model is obtained via a Henkin construction using the patchwork property.

### Completeness

**Theorem**: If C\_0 is satisfiable, then there exists a sequence of nondeterministic choices yielding an open completion graph.

**Proof sketch**: Given a model I with d\_0 in C\_0^I, maintain a guide function pi: V -> Delta^I mapping tableau nodes to model elements, with invariants:
- L(x) is a subset of the type of pi(x) in I
- E(x,y) equals the actual relation between pi(x) and pi(y) in I

The model guides all nondeterministic choices:
- **(or-rule)**: choose the disjunct true at pi(x)
- **(exists-rule)**: set pi(y) = d' where d' witnesses the demand in I; choose S\_z = relation between pi(z) and d' in I

Clash-freeness follows from the model satisfying composition and type consistency. Blocked nodes' demands need not be directly satisfied in the completion graph --- they are satisfied in the infinite model constructed from the extracted quasimodel.

### Comparison with Tree-Based DL Tableaux

| Feature | Standard ALCI Tableau | ALCI\_RCC5 Tableau |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Structure | Forest (tree per root) | **Complete graph** |
| New node edges | Single edge to parent | **Edge to every existing node** |
| Structural invariant | Tree shape | **Composition consistency (CF)** |
| Blocking | Pairwise (node + parent match) | **Simple type equality** |
| Soundness | Direct model readoff | **Indirect: quasimodel extraction + Henkin** |
| Key enabler | Tree model property | **Patchwork property** |
